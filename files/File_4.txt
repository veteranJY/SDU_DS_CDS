  When they get to the part where he's breaking her heart
 It can really make me cry just like before it's yesterday once more
Looking back on how it was in years gone by
  And the good time that I had
  Makes today seem rather sad so much has changed
  It was songs of love that I would sing to them 
  And I'd memorize each word 
Those old melodies still sound so good to me
  As they melt the years away
  Every sha la la la  every wo wo  still shine
  Every shinga linga ling that they're starting to sing so fine
  All my best memories Come back clearly to me
  Some can even make me cry Just like before It"s yesterday once more

No matter what  Boyzone

No matter what they tell us  
No matter what they do  
No matter what they teach us  
What we believe is true
