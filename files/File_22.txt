You'll always be the dream 
That fills my head  
You'll always be the one Iknow 
I'll never forget  
It's no use looking back or wondering 
Because love is a strange and funny thing  
No matter how I try and try 
I just can't say goodbye 
believe in yourself.
consider things from every angle.
​All for one, one for all. 
 [] Dumas pére 
Other men live to eat, while I eat to live. 
 Socrates  
Easy come, easy go. 
  Hazlitt 
Love rules his kingdom without a sword. 
 Herbert  
We soon believe what we desire.
