For you I bleed myself dry   ,

It's true                       
Look how they shine for you    
Look how they shine for you    
Look how they shine for you    !
Look how they shine for you    !
Look how they shine for you    
Look how they shine 
 
Look at the stars    
Look how they shine for you   
And all the things that you do  

Memory
Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smilling alone
In the lamplight
