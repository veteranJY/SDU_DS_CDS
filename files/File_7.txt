No matter what  

No matter what (no, no matter, no) () 
No, no matter  
That's all that matters to me 
  

Just one last dance
Just one last dance....oh baby...just one last dance ,, 
We meet in the night in the Spanish caf√©  
I look in your eyes just don't know what to say  
It feels like I'm drowning in salty water  
A few hours left 'til the sun's gonna rise  
Tomorrow will come an it's time to realize  
Our love has finished forever  
How I wish to come with you (wish to come with you)  
How I wish we make it through  

Just one last dance  
Before we say goodbye
