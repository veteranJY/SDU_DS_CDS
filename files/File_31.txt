15When theres no expectation, losing wont bring hurt, gaining makes you surprised.



16Sometimes your plans dont work out because God has better ones.



17How much truth of heart in ones life is told in a joke?



18A relationship should be between two people, not the whole world.



19You cant have a better tomorrow if you dont stop thinking about yesterday.
