And I mustnt give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Brunt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies
Another night is over
Another day is dawning
Touch me
Its so easy to leave me
All alone with my memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me
Youll understand what happiness
Look a new day
Has begun
larger than life
When youÂ´re screaming my name, alright
