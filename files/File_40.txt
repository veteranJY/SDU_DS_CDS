25Genius only means hard-working all one's life.



Mendeleyev

26Few things are impossible in themselves; and it is often for want of will ,

rather than of means, that man fails to succeed.



La Racheforcauld

27Dare and the world always yields.

If it beats you sometimes, dare it again and again and it will succumb.
