And I will keep you safe and strong  
And shelter from the storm  
No matter where it's barren  
A dream is being born  
(Ooh) 
No matter who they follow  
No matter where they lead  
No matter how they judge us  
I'll be everyone you need  

No matter if the sun don't shine (sun don't shine)() 
Or if the skies are blue (skies are blue) () 
No matter what the end is  
My life began with you  

I can't deny what I believe (what I believe, yeah) () 
I can't be what I'm not  
(I know, I know) I know this love's forever () 
That's all that matters now
