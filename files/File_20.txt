Always love U ! 


Never Had A Dream Come  
Everybody's got something 
They had to leave behind  
One regret from yesterday 
That just seems to grow with time  
There's no use looking back or wondering 
How it could be now or 4)might have been  

All this I know but still I can't find ways 
To let you go  
I never had a dream come true 
Till the day that found you  
Even though I pretend that I moved on 
You'll always be my baby  
I never found the words to say 
You're the one I think about each day
