No matter what they call us  
However they attack  
No matter where they take us  
We'll find our own way back  

I can't deny what I believe  
I can't be what I'm not  
I know our love forever  
I know, no matter what  

If only tears were laughter (ooh)  
If only night was day (ooh)  
If only prayers were answered (hear my prayers) () 
Then we would hear God say (say)  

No matter what they tell you (ooh)  
No matter what they do (ooh)  
No matter what they teach you  
What you believe is true
