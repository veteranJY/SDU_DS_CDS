The withered leaves collect at my feet
And wind
Begins to moan 
Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smill at the old days
I was beatiful then
I remember
The time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory
Live again
Every street lamp
Seems the best
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters
And a streetlamp gutter
And soon it will be morning
Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
