if i had to live my life without you near me 
the days would all be empty                  
the nights would seem so long               
you i see forever oh so clearly              
i might have been in love before            
but i've never felt this strong                  
our dreams are young and we both know  
theyll  take us where we want to go    
hold me now   touch me now                
i don't want to live without you              

nothing's gonna change my love for you       
you oughta know by now how much i love you  
one thing you can be sure of                   
i never ask for more than your love             
 nothing's gonna change my love for you    
you oughta know by now how much i love you    
the world may change my whole life through  
but nothing's gonna change my love for you
