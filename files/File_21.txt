And I know no matter where life takes me to 
A part of me will always be with you.  
Somewhere in my memory 
I've lost all sense of time , . 
And tomorrow can never be 
Cause yesterday is all that fills my mind , . 
There's no use looking back or wondering 
How it could be now or might have been  

All this I know but still I can't find ways 
To let you go  
I never had a dream come true 
Till the day that found you  
Even though I pretend that I moved on 
You'll always be my baby  
I never found the words to say 
You're the one I think about each day  

And I know no matter where life takes me to 
A part of me will always be with you.
