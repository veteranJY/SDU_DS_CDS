Oh what a thing to have done   
And it was all yellow  
Your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones   
Turn into something beautiful  
Do'you know?            
You know I love you so   
You know I love you so   

I swam across   
I jumped across for you  
Oh what a thing to do   
'Cos you were all yellow   
I drew a line   
I drew a line for you   
Oh what a thing to do   
And it was all yellow   
And your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones 
Turn into something beautiful     
Do'you know?                 
For you I bleed myself dry
