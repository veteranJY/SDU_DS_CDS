But let me tell you now 
there are prices to fame, alright 
All of our time spent in flashes of light 

All you people can´t you see, can´t you see 
how your love´s affecting our reality 
Everytime we´re down 
you can make it right 
And that makes you larger than life 

looking at the crowd 
and I see your body sway, c´moncome on! 
Wishin I could thank you in a different way, c´mon 
´Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive 
 

All you people can´t you see, can´t you see 
how your love´s affecting our reality 
Everytime we´re down 
you can make it right
