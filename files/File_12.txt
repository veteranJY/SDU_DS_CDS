'cause the whole world has got you dancing
That's right - I'm telling you
It's time to start believing - oh yes
Believing who you are - you are a shining star
[Chorus]


oh,yes~!~


YELLOW cold play
Look at the stars   
Look how they shine for you   
And everything you do    
Yeah, they were all yellow   
I came along   
I wrote a song for you   
And all the things you do  
And it was called yellow   ""
So then I took my turn
