13I lied when I said I didnt like you. I lied when I said I didnt care. I lie every time I try to tell myself I will never fall for you.


14One needs 3 things to be truly happy living in the world: some thing to do, some one to love, some thing to hope for.


15No matter how bad your heart has been broken, the world doesnt stop for your grief. The sun comes right back up the next day.


16Accept what was and what is, and youll have more positive energy to pursue what will be.


17Until you make peace with who you are, youll never be content with what you have.


18If you would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it. Every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
