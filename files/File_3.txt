if the road ahead is not so easy               
our love will lead the way for us    like a guiding star          
i'll be there for you if you should need me    
you don't have to change a thing             
i love you just the way you are           
so come with me and share the view    
i help you see forever too          
hold me now    touch me now      
i don't want to live without you      

Yesterday Once More
When I was young I'd listen to the radio
  Waiting for my favorite songs
  When they played I'd sing along it made me smile  
Those were such happy times and not so long ago
  How I wonder where they'd gone
  But they're back again just like a long lost friend
  All the songs I love so well
  Every sha la la la  every wo wo  still shine
  Every shinga linga ling that they're starting to sing so fine
