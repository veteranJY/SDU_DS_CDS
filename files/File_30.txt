10A guy who whispers in your ears, saying  Its alright, Im here. Holds you when youre sad, and treasures everything about you. Thats the guy I want to give my heart to.



11Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.



12We all have moments of desperation. But if we can face them head on, thats when we find out just how strong we really are.



13If they throw stones at you, dont throw back, use them to build your own foundation instead.



14If your happiness depends on what somebody else does, I guess you do have a problem.
